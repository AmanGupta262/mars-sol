# mars-sol
In the documentation of the NASA API, you can see that the API also works with sol (Martian rotation or day) as input. This time we will take 'sol' and 'page' as input and fetch images from API (https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000&amp;api_key=DEMO_KEY)
